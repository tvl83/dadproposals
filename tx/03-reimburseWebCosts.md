# For Proposal Table

I would like to request reimbursement of costs for running a front end website for the DAO. This is not payment for my time or work but for the hardware costs associated with running the website. It was brought up that this is an appropriate request so this is my formal request for reimbursement of $110 for 6 months of server costs for both https://daddydao.io and https://talk.daddydao.io and $60 for the registration of the domain. I will transfer ownership of the domain to the DAO as well. Voting for this proposal will reimburse me, Thomas Le, a total of $170 for associated server costs for running the websites I have provided for the community. Voting against this proposal will not reimburse me for any server costs I have incurred over the past 6 months.
