# Reimburse for Website Costs

## Summary
I would like to request reimbursement of costs for running a front end website for the DAO. This is not payment for my time or work but for the hardware costs associated with running the website.

## Description
It was brought up that this is an appropriate request so this is my formal request for reimbursement of $110 for 6 months of server costs for both https://daddydao.io and https://talk.daddydao.io and $60 for the registration of the domain. I will transfer ownership of the domain to the DAO as well.

## For
Voting for this proposal will reimburse me, Thomas Le, a total of $170 for associated server costs for running the websites I have provided for the community.

## Against
Voting against this proposal will not reimburse me for any server costs I have incurred over the past 6 months
