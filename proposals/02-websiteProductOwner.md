# Website Product Owner

## Summary
Designate myself, Thomas Le (Telegram: @tvle83), as Product Owner of the official website for DAPP Account DAO.

## Motivation
I have been part of the community since the beginning, bringing up a website (https://daddydao.io) within a week or so of the launch of the smart contracts. I am a trusted member of the community and a msig signor on the contracts.

I have a full time job and haven't been able to keep up with all the changes. The website has fallen a little behind. I will open source the website code and allow for pull requests to add-to and improve the website by the community at large. 

I will also create and disperse bounties to motivate the community contributions to the website. 

## For
Voting for this proposal will designate me, Thomas Le, as Product Owner of the official website for the DAPP Account DAO and empower me to perform the duties listed above.

## Against
Voting against this proposal will not designate me, Thomas Le, as Product Owner of the official website for the DAPP Account DAO.
