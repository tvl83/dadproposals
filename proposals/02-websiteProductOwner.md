# Website Product Owner

## Summary
Designate myself, Thomas Le (Telegram: @tvle83), as Product Owner of the official website for DAPP Account DAO.

## Motivation
I have been part of the community since the beginning, bringing up a website (https://daddydao.io) within a week or so of the launch of the smart contracts. I am a trusted member of the community and a msig signor on the contracts.

I have a full time job and haven't been able to keep up with all the changes. The website has fallen a little behind. I will open source the website code and allow for pull requests to add-to and improve the website by the community at large. 

I will also create and disperse bounties to motivate the community contributions to the website. 

I will set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) so that pull requests that are approved and merged will automatically be pushed to a test environment and then ultimately deployed to the production environment.

I will be reimbursed for monthly costs that will approximately be $50/month for server costs. Actual costs will be invoiced and made publicly available.

I will continue to work and make changes to the website too, of course. 

More responsibilities can be added with proposals from the DAO. 

Being the product owner does not exclude me from bounties. If a bounty is not worked on or claimed within 30 days of announcement I will be eligible to work on it. 

I will also take the responsibility of managing and/or delegating the DNS records and other configuration requirements related to the websites and domains, if the DAO wishes it. 

## For
Voting for this proposal will designate me, Thomas Le, as Product Owner of the official website for the DAPP Account DAO and imbue me to perform the duties listed above.

## Against
Voting against this proposal will not designate me, Thomas Le, as Product Owner of the official website for the DAPP Account DAO.
