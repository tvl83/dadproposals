# Add Thomas Le as Collaborator to source repositories (Trying again)

## Summary
Add myself, Thomas Le (telegram: @tvle83, github: @tvl83), as a collaborator to the source code repositories.

This is a duplicate of proposal #79 that passed. The reason for the duplicate proposal is that there is not an ability to add a view-only collaborator to a private repository. So this proposal would give me edit access to the source of the smart contracts. This does not danger the source code in any way. All history of changes are recorded in git, that's a primary purpose of source control.

I am submitting again because even though the previous proposal received 100% YES votes, it did not get 10% of the total DAD supply. This is an attempt to get it with that 10% of total supply. 

## Motivation
It was talked about early on that a few community members should be given access to the source code. I am also a software developer and would love to learn more about how the smart contracts work and how they are written by a professional team.

## For
Voting for this proposal will give me, Thomas Le, access to the smart contract source code repositories.

## Against
Voting against this proposal will not give me, Thomas Le, access to the smart contract source code repositories. No permissions will change on the source code repositories.
