# Source Code Access for Thomas Le

## Summary
Add myself, Thomas Le (telegram: @tvle83, github: @tvl83), to view only collaborator to the source code repositories.

## Motivation
It was talked about early on that a few community members should be given access to the source code. I am also a software developer and would love to learn more about how the smart contracts work and how they are written by a professional team.

## For
Voting for this proposal will give me, Thomas Le, read-only access to the smart contract source code repositories.

## Against
Voting for this proposal will not give me, Thomas Le, read-only access to the smart contract source code repositories. No permissions will change on the source code repositories.
